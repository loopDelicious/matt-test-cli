  "description": "A simple `GET` request to `/time/start` to return a relative timstamp in the past from the specified / current timestamp (as provided in the `unit` query parameter).\n\nFor instance, if the `unit` has been specified as `month`, the returned timestamp would indicate the beginning of the current month. Similar results are returned for other units of time, like: `years`, `months`, `days`, `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds`, and `milliseconds`\n\nThis endpoint accepts `timestamp`, `locale`, `format`, and `strict` query parameters to construct the date time instance to check against.\n\nResponses are provided in JSON format, with a `start` key to indicate the result. The response code is `200` for valid query parameters, and `400` otherwise.\n\n```\n{\n  start: \"A timestamp from the past, depending on the `unit` specified\"\n}\n```"
