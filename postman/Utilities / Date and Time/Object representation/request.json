  "description": "A simple `GET` request to `/time/object` to return the current / provided timestamp as a JSON object.\n\nFor instance, if the `unit` has been specified as `month`, the returned timestamp would indicate the beginning of the current month. Similar results are returned for other units of time, like: `years`, `months`, `days`, `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds`, and `milliseconds`\n\nThis endpoint accepts `timestamp`, `locale`, `format`, and `strict` query parameters to construct the date time instance to check against.\n\nResponses are provided in JSON format. The response code is `200` for valid query parameters, and `400` otherwise.\n\n```\n{\n  years: 2016,\n  months: 10,\n  days: 10,\n  hours: 23,\n  minutes: 34,\n  seconds: 20,\n  milliseconds: 980\n}\n```"
