  "description": "A simple `GET` request to `/time/between` to check if the provided timestamp is between a range specified by the `start` and `end` query parameters. A resolution limit can also be specified by the `unit` query parameter.\n\nFor instance, for a resolution `unit` of `month`,\n`2016-10-05` does lie between `2016-11-02` and `2016-09-01`.\n\nThis endpoint also accepts `timestamp`, `locale`, `format`, `strict`, and `target` query parameters to construct the date time instance to check against.\n\nResponses are provided in JSON format, with a `between` key to indicate the result. The response code is `200` for valid query parameters, and `400` otherwise.\n\n```\n{\n  between: true/false\n}\n```"
