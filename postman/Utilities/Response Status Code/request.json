  "description": "This endpoint allows one to instruct the server which status code to respond with.\n\nEvery response is accompanied by a status code. The status code provides a summary of the nature of response sent by the server. For example, a status code of `200` means everything is okay with the response and a code of `404` implies that the requested URL does not exist on server. \nA list of all valid HTTP status code can be found at the [List of Status Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) wikipedia article. When using Postman, the response status code is described for easy reference.\n\nNote that if an invalid status code is requested to be sent, the server returns a status code of `400 Bad Request`."
