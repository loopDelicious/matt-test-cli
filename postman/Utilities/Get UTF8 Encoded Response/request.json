  "description": "If a response of an endpoint requires to send data beyond the basic English / ASCII character set, the `charset` parameter in the `Content-Type` response header defines the character encoding policy.\n\nThis endpoint returns an `UTF8` character encoded response body with text in various languages such as Greek, Latin, East Asian, etc. Postman can interpret the character encoding and use appropriate methods to display the character set in responses."
