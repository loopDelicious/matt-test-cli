  "description": "This endpoint allows one to recieve streaming http response using [chunked transfer encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding) of a configurable length.\n\nA streaming response does not wait for the entire response to be generated on server before flushing it out. This implies that for a fairly large response, parts of it can be streamed to the requestee as and when it is generated on server. The client can then take actions of processing this partially received data."
