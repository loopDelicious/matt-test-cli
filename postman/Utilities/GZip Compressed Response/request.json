  "description": "This endpoint returns the response using [gzip compression algoritm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip).\nThe uncompressed response is a JSON string containing the details of the request sent by the client. For this endpoint to work, one should request with `Accept-encoding` header containing `gzip` as part of its value. Postman supports gzip, deflate and SDCH decoding and automatically sends them as part of the request.\n\nHTTP Compression allows the server to send responses in a compressed format, which is uncompressed by the client before processing. This reduces network bandwidth consumption at the cost of increase in CPU usage.\nTo know more about this, refer the [HTTP Compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_compression) wikipedia article."
