  "description": "The HTTP `PUT` request method is similar to HTTP `POST`. It too is meant to \ntransfer data to a server (and elicit a response). What data is returned depends on the implementation\nof the server.\n\nA `PUT` request can pass parameters to the server using \"Query String \nParameters\", as well as the Request Body. For example, in the following \nraw HTTP request,\n\n> PUT /hi/there?hand=wave\n>\n> <request-body>\n\n\n"
