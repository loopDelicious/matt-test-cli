  "description": "The HTTP `DELETE` method is used to delete resources on a server. The exact\nuse of `DELETE` requests depends on the server implementation. In general, \n`DELETE` requests support both, Query String parameters as well as a Request \nBody.\n\nThis endpoint accepts an HTTP `DELETE` request and provides debug information\nsuch as the HTTP headers, Query String arguments, and the Request Body."
