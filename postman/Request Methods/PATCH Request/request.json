  "description": "The HTTP `PATCH` method is used to update resources on a server. The exact\nuse of `PATCH` requests depends on the server in question. There are a number\nof server implementations which handle `PATCH` differently. Technically, \n`PATCH` supports both Query String parameters and a Request Body.\n\nThis endpoint accepts an HTTP `PATCH` request and provides debug information\nsuch as the HTTP headers, Query String arguments, and the Request Body."
